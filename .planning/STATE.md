## Current milestone

**Waves 70–71 complete — 904 bridges, 3,198 graph nodes, 1,055 hypotheses**

The repository remains above the 800-bridge threshold and the 1,000-hypothesis threshold; the knowledge graph is now **3,198 nodes / 3,460 edges** after rebuilding following a merge with upstream `main`. OpenAlex automation is live with a weekly cron job. Nine bridge stubs sit in `drafts/bridges/` awaiting promotion.

## Current focus

- **arXiv preprint**: `docs/preprint/usdr_preprint.md` is ready; next step is PDF conversion and submission to cs.DL (author: Brandon Shoemaker).
- **Bridge count toward 1,000**: promote `drafts/bridges/` stubs; continue wave-based build.
- **Dashboard graph reliability**: D3 interactive graph must load consistently on GitHub Pages.
- **Contributor on-ramps**: good-first-issues, `docs/QUICK_START_CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Community outreach**: Reddit r/OpenScience post ready at `docs/outreach/reddit_openscience_post.md`.

## Active git branches / PRs

- `main` — default; all PRs squash-merged here; CI: validate-schemas + mkdocs + markdown-link-check.
- Any active feature branch: `feat/...` — check GitHub Pull Requests tab.

## Shipped in this session (2026-05-04)

- **Bridge system** (schemas, validator, 7 bridges) — the core anti-tunnel-vision primitive.
- **11 unknowns + 11 hypotheses** — seeded from 4 arXiv harvests.
- **3 prompt templates** (literature synthesis, hypothesis comparison, falsification, bridge discovery).
- **Developer dashboard** updated with bridge stat card and current counts.
- **GitHub Pages** live at [kr8zysho3.github.io/Universal-Science-Discovery/](https://kr8zysho3.github.io/Universal-Science-Discovery/).

## Blocked / needs human

- None.

## Next actions (max 5)

1. **Submit arXiv preprint** — convert `docs/preprint/usdr_preprint.md` to PDF, submit to cs.DL + cross-list q-bio.QM, physics.soc-ph. Author: Brandon Shoemaker. See `docs/PATH_TO_SUCCESS.md` for steps.
2. **Promote `drafts/bridges/` stubs** — 9 stubs from OpenAlex harvest ready; promote to full bridges with translation tables and DOIs.
3. **Post to Reddit r/OpenScience** — post ready at `docs/outreach/reddit_openscience_post.md`. Best time: Tuesday–Thursday 9–11am EST.
4. **Register custom domain** — check usdr.science / sciencebridges.org; configure GitHub Pages CNAME.
5. **Enable GitHub Discussions** — seed "Introduce yourself", "Bridge proposals", "Open questions" threads.
