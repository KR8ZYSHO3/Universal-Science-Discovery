## Current focus

- **Content seeding**: running arXiv harvests (q-bio, cond-mat:stat-mech, nlin, bio-ph) to seed unknowns, hypotheses, and bridges.
- **Bridge discovery**: every harvest is checked against the bridge-discovery prompt in `docs/prompts/bridge_discovery.md`.
- **Contributor discoverability**: GitHub Issues to be created from open unknowns (next action).
- **Schema discipline**: all YAML validated by `scripts/validate_schemas.py` on every PR.

## Active git branches / PRs

- `main` — default; all PRs squash-merged here; CI: validate-schemas + mkdocs + markdown-link-check.
- Any active feature branch: `feat/...` — check GitHub Pull Requests tab.

## Shipped in this session (2026-05-04)

- **Bridge system** (schemas, validator, 7 bridges) — the core anti-tunnel-vision primitive.
- **11 unknowns + 11 hypotheses** — seeded from 4 arXiv harvests.
- **3 prompt templates** (literature synthesis, hypothesis comparison, falsification, bridge discovery).
- **Developer dashboard** updated with bridge stat card and current counts.
- **GitHub Pages** live at [kr8zysho3.github.io/Universal-Science-Discovery/](https://kr8zysho3.github.io/Universal-Science-Discovery/).

## Blocked / needs human

- None.

## Next actions (max 5)

- Create GitHub Issues from the most compelling open unknowns for contributor discoverability.
- Write `u-quantum-biology-decoherence` — the open question raised by b-quantum-biology-navigation.
- Run a `q-bio:q-bio:TO` (tissues and organs) harvest to seed the topology-morphogenesis bridge further.
- Update the developer dashboard stat counts after each PR that adds catalog entries.
- Keep `schemas/unknown.yaml`, `schemas/hypothesis.yaml`, `schemas/bridge.yaml` in sync when adding new optional fields.
