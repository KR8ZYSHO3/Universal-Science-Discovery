# Cross-domain bridges

A **bridge entry** captures an explicit connection between two or more scientific
fields studying the same underlying phenomenon with different language, methods, or
tools — and with little awareness of each other.

Bridge files live under `cross-domain/` in the repository root,
validated against `schemas/bridge.yaml`.

## Why bridges matter

When physics, biology, chemistry, and medicine each study the same phenomenon, they often
rediscover it independently — wasting decades. Bridges make the connection explicit so that:

- Researchers can borrow tools and vocabulary from adjacent fields.
- Experiments that are impossible in one field become routine in another.
- Journal siloing stops hiding obvious collaborations.

## Schema

Each bridge requires at minimum:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Stable `b-...` identifier |
| `title` | One-sentence equivalence statement |
| `status` | `proposed / established / contested / stale` |
| `fields` | At least two disciplines |
| `bridge_claim` | Precise description of the mapping |

Optional enrichment fields: `translation_table`, `cross_pollination_opportunities`,
`communication_gap`, `related_unknowns`, `related_hypotheses`, `references`.

Full schema: `schemas/bridge.yaml` in the repository root.

## Contributing a bridge

1. Pick two fields you suspect are studying the same thing with different vocabulary.
2. Copy the template below into `cross-domain/<field-a>-<field-b>/b-<short-name>.yaml`.
3. Run `python scripts/validate_schemas.py` — it now validates bridge entries automatically.
4. Open a PR describing the connection and at least one `cross_pollination_opportunity`.

```yaml
id: b-your-bridge-name
title: "..."
status: proposed
fields:
  - field-a
  - field-b
bridge_claim: >
  ...
```
